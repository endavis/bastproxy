Logging uses the standard python logging module.

libs.logs:
    All handlers are removed from root and new custom ones are added
        ConsoleHandler
        TimedRotatingFileHandler
        ClientHandler

    Each of those handlers verifies with plugins.core.log whether the message
    can be emitted by the handler at the specified level.
    Messages that are LogRecords with multiple sources will only be emitted once
    from the same handler. This is tracked with a dictionary in the LogRecord

    A CustomColorFormatter is added to color code log events, the colors can be
    changed with the plugins.core.log plugin

libs.records.rtypes.log
    has the implementation of LogRecord
    A LogRecord will pass all keyword arguments to the logger when the appropriate
    level function is invoked.

plugins.core.log
    sets the levels of log types in the handlers

plugins.debug.records
    If the message is a LogRecord from libs.records, it is tracked through the system
    to see modifications and can be inspected with #bp.core.records command

Handler Information:
    Console:
        By default, anything 'info' level or above is logged to the console
        To change the behavior of a specific log type, look at #bp.core.log.console

    File:
        By default, anything 'info' level or above is logged to the global log file
        To change the behavior of a specific log type, look at #bp.core.log.file

    Client
        By default, anything 'error' level or above is logged to the client
        To change the behavior of a specific log type, look at #bp.core.log.client
