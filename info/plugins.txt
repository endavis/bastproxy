Plugin Developer Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Notes for plugin instances
    Do not save plugin instances in long term storage, lookup plugin instances at runtime.
    Plugins can be reloaded and if the old plugin instance is still referenced it
    will not be garbage collected. The old plugin instance could interfere
    with the new plugin instance.

- Notes on reloading plugins:
    Rebuild data when plugin that uses the data is reloaded
        For example, the Command plugin uses decorators that put specific info on functions
        in a plugin. If the command plugin is reloaded, it searches all plugins for functions
        with this info.

    Add data that needs to be saved on a reload to the reload cache with the apis. Be careful,
        do not store items in the cache that have references to anything in the plugin that will
        be reloaded
        libs.plugins.reloadutils:add.cache           | add data to the cache
        libs.plugins.reloadutils:get.plugin.cache    | get cache for a plugin
        libs.plugins.reloadutils:remove.plugin.cache | remove the cache for a plugin

    Reloading plugins does not update any objects that have been imported by another plugin.
    Try to keep imports into other plugins at a minimum or small use cases
        one such item is a decorator that is used by other plugins, if the module the decorator
        is defined in is reloaded then all the other modules that have used that decorator
        will have the old decorator and they will have references to the old module,
        meaning the old module will never be garbage collected until all the modules
        with the old reference have been reloaded.

- Plugin folder structure
    if a file should not be reloaded when a plugin is reloaded
        add a CANRELOAD = False line to the file
    Location: plugins.core.events - the main directory
        a "plugin" directory under the main directory
            this is the location of the plugin class
            it is recommended to only include modules that are not statically imported by other modules
                in this directory
        a "libs" directory under the main directory
            best practice is to expose only those things other plugins need
                in the plugin's main directory/__init__.py

- Adding Commands
    It must be a Plugin method and the name of the method must start with _command_

    By default, the name of the command will then be anything after _command_
        E.G. If the method name is "_command_list" then the command will be "list"
            This can be overridden, see the AddCommand decorator

    3 decorators are then used for various settings on the command
        import them from plugins.core.commands
        Note: all 3 are not required, and only one needs to be used for the automated mechanism to add the command
        @AddCommand decorator:
            The following arguments can be used in AddCommand (mainly from the arguments for plugins.core.commands.Command.__init__ kwargs)
                group - to group commands
                autoadd - automatically add the command
                    set this to False to programatically add a command at runtime given certain conditions and
                        bypass the automated method
                    see the reset command in BasePlugin
                name - used to set the name of the command, otherwise it is generated from the name of the function
                    can be used in conjunction with attributes of the Plugin instance that owns the function
                    see the plugins.core.ssc plugin
                show_in_history - flag to show in command history, True (default) shows in history, False does not show in history
                format - flag to format the command, True (default) formats the command, False does not format the command
                shelp - the short help string
                    can be used in conjunction with attributes of the class instance that owns the function
                preamble - flag to include the proxy preamble, True (default) includes the preamble, False does not include the preamble

        @AddParser decorator:
            These arguments are passed directly to the argparse.ArgumentParser constructor
            The help and description keywords can be used in conjunction with attributes of the Plugin instance that owns the function

            @AddParser(description='inspect a plugin')

        @AddArgument decorator
            These arguments are passed directly to the ArgumentParser.add_argument function
            @AddArgument('-o',
                            '--object',
                            help='show an object of the plugin, can be method or variable',
                            default='')
            @AddArgument('-s',
                            '--simple',
                            help='show a simple output',
                            action='store_true')

    To retrieve the command arguments inside of the command function do the following:
        args = self.api('plugins.core.commands:get.current.command.args')()

    The return values for the command is a tuple of two items:
        bool: flag if the command ran successfully or not
            if this is False, then the command's help will also be output to the client
        list[str]: the data to output to the client

- Adding to the API
    Use the decorator AddAPI from libs.api
        Note: does not have to be a plugin method or even a Class method, can be a regular function
        @AddAPI('get.data.directory', description='get the data directory for this plugin')
        def _api_get_data_directory(self):
            \""" get the data directory for this plugin \"""
            return self.plugin_info.data_directory

- Events
    Registering to an event:
        Use the decorator RegisterToEvent from plugins.core.events
            @RegisterToEvent(event_name='ev_plugin_save')
            def _eventcb_settings_plugin_save(self):
                if event_record := self.api(
                    'plugins.core.events:get.current.event.record'
                )():
                    plugin_id = event_record['plugin_id']
                    self.api(f"{self.plugin_id}:save.plugin")(plugin_id)

    Get the current Event record with the api('plugins.core.events:get.current.event.record')()
        The record type is EventArgsRecord in libs/records/rtypes/eventargs.py
        It is a subclass of dict so can be added and modified in the same way as a dict

    Unregister with the api('plugins.core.events:unregister.from.event')
