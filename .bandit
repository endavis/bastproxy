# Bandit security scanner configuration for BastProxy
#
# This configuration excludes certain checks that are false positives
# for a MUD proxy application that intentionally uses Telnet protocol.

# Skip these tests:
# B401: telnet module - MUD proxy requires telnet for game server communication
# B604: shell parameter - telnetlib3 uses 'shell' parameter for connection handlers (not shell commands)
skips = ['B401', 'B604']

# Report only medium and high severity issues
# Low severity issues are informational and don't need to block CI
# severity = MEDIUM,HIGH

# Only report high confidence issues to reduce false positives
# confidence = HIGH
